# Fractol
Explore the magic of fractals and the graphics library MiniLibX

<br/>

## üìö Compiling MiniLibX
In your Makefile, you must compile MiniLibX using its own Makefile and then copy the library libmlx.dylib to your current directory.
**WHY??**
dyld: Library not loaded: libmlx.dylib

Notice that MiniLibX is a dynamic library.

### üí° Dynamic Library
A [Dynamic Library](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/27133/dynamic-library) is only loaded into your programme at run time, meaning it is not included in your executable.
Whereas a Static Library becomes part of your programme during its compilation, thus being part of the executable.
Learn more about the advantages and disadvantages of [static and dynamic libraries](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/a1-static-and-dynamic-libraries/).

## üñº Getting familiar with MiniLibX
Follow the [MiniLibX documentation on 42Docs](https://harm-smits.github.io/42docs/libs/minilibx.html) and these [guides and tutorials on MiniLibX](https://gontjarow.github.io/MiniLibX/).

## üê∞ The beauty of mathematics
One of the most fascinating things is to realise that all these fractals are generated from iterating a very simple (yet complex) equation.
