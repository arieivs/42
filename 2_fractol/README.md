# Fractol
Explore the magic of fractals and the graphics library MiniLibX

<br/>

## üìö Compiling MiniLibX
In your Makefile, you must compile MiniLibX using its own Makefile and then copy the library libmlx.dylib to your current directory.
**WHY??**
dyld: Library not loaded: libmlx.dylib

Notice that MiniLibX is a dynamic library.

### üí° Dynamic Library
A [Dynamic Library](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/27133/dynamic-library) is only loaded into your programme at run time, meaning it is not included in your executable.
Whereas a Static Library becomes part of your programme during its compilation, thus being part of the executable.
Learn more about the advantages and disadvantages of [static and dynamic libraries](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/a1-static-and-dynamic-libraries/).

## üñº Getting familiar with MiniLibX
Follow the [MiniLibX documentation on 42Docs](https://harm-smits.github.io/42docs/libs/minilibx.html) and these [guides and tutorials on MiniLibX](https://gontjarow.github.io/MiniLibX/).

## üê∞ The beauty of mathematics
One of the most fascinating things is to realise that all these fractals are generated from iterating a very simple (yet complex) equation.
Dive into the maths with this [Numberphile video on Julia sets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFftmWSzgmk), this [Numberphile video on the Mandelbrot set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGMRB4O922I) and if you're still curious check this [video from Veritasium on the logistic map](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovJcsL7vyrk).

As you've noticed, it all goes around the following equation:
```
z(n + 1) = z(n) + c
```
Where both z and c are complex numbers (z is our variable, c a constant) and n is the iteration count.

For the Burning ships fractal (bonus) you simply need to use the absolute values of both the real and imaginary parts of z:
```
z(n + 1) = |Re(z(n))| + |Im(z(n))| + c
```

## üé® Let's render some fractals
Follow [this tutorial on how to render the Mandelbrot set](http://warp.povusers.org/Mandelbrot/).
The Julia set and Burning ships fractal are almost the same!
Apply the same logic, just with minor changes in the mathematical equations.
