How to navigate the stormy waters of Docker

If you are new to Docker and containers, here are my suggestions:

## Learn about Containers
Watch [Network Chuck's video on Docker 101](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGz9DS-aIeY) and [IBM's video on Containers vs Virtual Machines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qotVMX-J5s).

## Install Docker
At school: install Docker via the Managed Software Center.
Open the application and once it is up and running, try the following command: ```docker run hello-world```
If you get an error saying your Docker daemon isn't running, [try this](https://pitman.io/posts/fix-docker-wont-start-error-on-mac-os/).

## Get familiar with Docker
Get comfortable with Docker's terminology and play around with existing docker images before starting to create your own.
* Follow the [Docker curriculum](https://docker-curriculum.com/#setting-up-your-computer) tutorial
* Explore [vvarodi's Github](https://github.com/vvarodi/ft_server)
* Watch [Get started with Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/)

## Create your Dockerfile
What is your Dockerfile supposed to do?
That's what I am still trying to figure out...
