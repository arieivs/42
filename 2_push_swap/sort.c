/* BUBBLE SORT
keep on raing
when one is bigger than the next, sa, then ra
need to know how big the stack is
keep doing it until it's sorted
alternative: pb instead of ra
*/

/* SELECTION SORT
go though the list and find the smallest
pb all of it including the smallest
rb
pa everything back except for the smallest
do it all again until it's sorted
*/

/*Both strategies seem largely inefficient...*/
