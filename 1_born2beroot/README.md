**Package manager** (shamelessly copied from Wikipedia) is a collection of software tools that automates the process of installing, upgrading, configuring and removing computer programmes in a consistent manner.

**APT (Advanced Package Tool)** and **Aptitude** are both package managers for Debian OS.

Note: We used apt-get in ft_server!

**APPArmor** and **SELinux** check at home

more things related to Debian I should be aware of?

**SSH (Secure Shell) Protocol** read more about this toooo 

**UFW** stands for Uncomplicated Firewall

## ðŸ“¦ Using VirtualBox at school
Install VirtualBox via the Managed Software Center.
Store your Virtual Machine on /sgoinfre/user_name to avoid storage issues (you can access this folder from any of the school's computers)
