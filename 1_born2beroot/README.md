Welcome to the Matrix ðŸ˜Ž

## ðŸ¤” What are Virtual Machines?
Watch [NetworkChuck's video on Virtual Machines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wX75Z-4MEoM).

<br />

## ðŸ’¡ Key Concepts
**Package manager** is a collection of software tools that automates the process of installing, upgrading, configuring and removing computer programmes in a consistent manner (shamelessly copied from Wikipedia).

**APT (Advanced Package Tool)** and **Aptitude** are both package managers for Debian OS.
APT has only a CLI, while Aptitude offers a GUI (and some other additional features).
Learn more about [apt vs aptitude](https://askubuntu.com/questions/347898/whats-difference-of-apt-get-and-aptitude), [these vs dpkg](https://askubuntu.com/questions/309113/what-is-the-difference-between-dpkg-and-aptitude-apt-get), [wajig and apt-get's easter egg](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/767/what-is-the-real-difference-between-apt-get-and-aptitude-how-about-wajig). 

**AppArmor** and **SELinux** (Security-Enhanced Linux) are both independent Linux Security Modules.
They both control who can and cannot access certain files or directories, protecting the OS and other applications from both external and internal threats.
"SELinux controls access based on the labels of the files and processes while AppArmor controls access based on the paths of the program files." (from [this article on AppArmor vs SELinux](https://www.omarine.org/blog/apparmor-vs-selinux/))

more things related to Debian I should be aware of?

**SSH (Secure Shell) Protocol** read more about this toooo 

**UFW** stands for Uncomplicated Firewall

kinds of files you can use for the new virtual hard disk: VDI (VirtualBox Disk Image, what we are using), VHD (Virtual Hard Disk), VMDK (Virtual Machine Disk).

iptables???

<br />

## ðŸ“¦ Using VirtualBox at school
Install VirtualBox via the Managed Software Center.
On VirtualBox settings, move the default folder "VirtualBox VMs" into sgoinfre/user_name to avoid storage issues (you can access this folder from any of the school's computers).

## ðŸŒ± Born to be Root
Follow [Antonio's amazing notes](https://www.notion.so/Born2BeRoot-6a10c2b772a74c20981c1c16b961b404) - that's basically what you need to know.
Some additional notes below:

1. Create a new Virtual Machine
* Create a new VM (with Debian 64-bit) and go for all recommended options;
* File size: if you're aiming for the bonus, choose 30.8 GB (conversion??) else keep it at 8GB;
* Host key: shortcut which allows you to getting out of the virtual machine when it's capturing your mouse and keyboard (it appears on the right-bottom corner of the window);
* No GUI is allowed, so you cannot choose Graphical Install (choose just Install) - not so sure

2. Partitions & LVM
Primary partition vs logical - search

[sda](https://www.tec4tric.com/linux/dev-sda-in-linux)

usage of partitions in real life: for boot and recovery? not much more? check it outtttt

file system: the most common one is Ext4
swap area is the swap file system

mirror similar to CDN

This ReadMe is under construction!

Happy virtualisation! ðŸ‘»
