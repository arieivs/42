Welcome to the Matrix ðŸ˜Ž

## ðŸ¤” What are Virtual Machines?
Watch [NetworkChuck's video on Virtual Machines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wX75Z-4MEoM)

<br />

## ðŸ’¡ Key Concepts
**Package manager** (shamelessly copied from Wikipedia) is a collection of software tools that automates the process of installing, upgrading, configuring and removing computer programmes in a consistent manner.

**APT (Advanced Package Tool)** and **Aptitude** are both package managers for Debian OS.
Check [differences between the two](https://www.tecmint.com/difference-between-apt-and-aptitude/) at home.
Note: We used apt-get in ft_server!

**APPArmor** and **SELinux** check at home

more things related to Debian I should be aware of?

**SSH (Secure Shell) Protocol** read more about this toooo 

**UFW** stands for Uncomplicated Firewall

kinds of files you can use for the new virtual hard disk: VDI (VirtualBox Disk Image, what we are using), VHD (Virtual Hard Disk), VMDK (Virtual Machine Disk).

iptables???

<br />

## ðŸ“¦ Using VirtualBox at school
Install VirtualBox via the Managed Software Center.
On VirtualBox settings, move the default folder "VirtualBox VMs" into sgoinfre/user_name to avoid storage issues (you can access this folder from any of the school's computers).

## ðŸŒ± Born to be Root
Follow [Antonio's amazing notes](https://www.notion.so/Born2BeRoot-6a10c2b772a74c20981c1c16b961b404) - that's basically what you need to know.
Some additional notes below:

1. Create a new Virtual Machine
* Create a new VM (with Debian 64-bit) and go for all recommended options;
* File size: if you're aiming for the bonus, choose 30.8 GB (conversion??) else keep it at 8GB;
* Host key: shortcut which allows you to getting out of the virtual machine when it's capturing your mouse and keyboard (it appears on the right-bottom corner of the window);
* No GUI is allowed, so you cannot choose Graphical Install (choose just Install) - not so sure

2. Partitions & LVM
Primary partition vs logical - search

[sda](https://www.tec4tric.com/linux/dev-sda-in-linux)

usage of partitions in real life: for boot and recovery? not much more? check it outtttt

file system: the most common one is Ext4
swap area is the swap file system

mirror similar to CDN

This ReadMe is under construction!

Happy virtualisation! ðŸ‘»
