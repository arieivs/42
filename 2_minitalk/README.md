## ðŸ”€ UNIX Processes
A process is an instance of running a programme.
Processes are usually created by another process, which is then the Parent process of that Child process.
They can then be identified by their Process ID (PID) or Parent Process ID (PPID).
When the computer boots, one of the last things the kernel does is to call the init process (e.g.'s: systemd, launchd, upstart), parent of all processes, which has the PID 1. 
If a Parent process is terminated before its Child, the Child process will be an Orphan and its Parent will now be the init process.

* *Foreground Process*: By default, a process runs in the foreground, meaning that while it is running, the prompt is not available.
* *Background Process*: One can execute other commands while this process runs in the background.
* *Daemon Process*: System-related background process.

Some useful commands:

```
ps -f           // process status with more detailed information
exec            // replace a process for another (the child for its parent once it ends)
<cmd> &         // run command/start process in the background
jobs            // jobs table
fg %<job ID>    // bring that particular job to the foreground
bg %<job ID>    // put process in the background
kill <PID>      // terminated process
```

### ðŸ¤” Why use Processes in our Programmes?
If a programme needs to run more than one function simultaneously, then we need to create a Child Process.
This way both functions are running simultaneously.
We can do this by using the fork() function.

## ðŸš¨ UNIX Signals
Signals are a way to communicate with a process.
When a signal is sent to a process, it stops whatever it is doing to handle the signal immediately.
We can define how a process deals with a specific signal by coding a signal handler, and assigning it to that signal using the ```signal``` or ```sigaction``` functions.
Watch [this video on signals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83M5-NPDeWs) and learn more about [handling signals](http://www.cs.kent.edu/~ruttan/sysprog/lectures/signals.html). 
We can also use the ```trap``` command to perform actions (such as removing temporary files) when the process is interrupted.
Learn more about [traps here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix/unix-signals-traps.htm).

### ðŸ”ª Killing Processes
You may code a signal handler so that the application ignores a SIGTERM (```kill``` or ```kill -15```) signal, or a SIGINT, or many others.
When that happens, we can force an application to quit using ```kill -9```, which will take the kernel to remove that process from the processes table, without even going through the application.

```
kill -l         // list of all kill signals one can use/send
kill -2 <PID>   // 2 = SIGINT, interrupting (ctrl + C)
kill -20 <PID>  // 20 (or 18, double check in your machine!) = SIGTSTP, suspending (ctrl + Z)
kill -18 <PID>  // 18 (or 19, double check in your machine!) = SIGCONT, continue
```

### ðŸŽ­ Masking and Sigaction
If a signal is sent while the previous one is still being handled, we can get into trouble.
In order to avoid this, we can block signals from being processed until the handler is free.
For that we can use Masks: we create a signal set, where we define to which signals the mask is to be applied, and then use it in the ```struct sigaction``` that we give to the ```sigaction function```.
```sigaction``` is more recent than ```signal``` and it blocks new signals from arriving while the respective handler is busy, with masking, by default.
