## IO stream
if we want to get an int from std::cin and something that doesn't match that data type is given, it fails, and potentially goes crazy.
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39282953/how-to-reset-stdcin-when-using-it
if (std::cin.fail())
{
	std::cin.clear();
	std::cin.ignore();
}

Right now if I press ctrl+D while waiting for user input, I close std::cin, thus it enters a sort of infinite crazy loop.

## Strings

std::string automatically allocates memory dynamically to the string, and frees it in the destructor.

When there's utf-8 characters involved, things might get tricky... the size is refering to the amount of bytes needed, so if a character (like Ã©) uses more bytes (in this case 2) it may make things more complicated... Luckily we have american keyboards at school
