## IO stream
if we want to get an int from std::cin and something that doesn't match that data type is given, it fails, and potentially goes crazy.
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39282953/how-to-reset-stdcin-when-using-it
if (std::cin.fail())
{
	std::cin.clear();
	std::cin.ignore();
}

Right now if I press ctrl+D while waiting for user input, I close std::cin, thus it enters a sort of infinite crazy loop.

## Strings

std::string automatically allocates memory dynamically to the string, and frees it in the destructor.

When there's utf-8 characters involved, things might get tricky... the size is refering to the amount of bytes needed, so if a character (like Ã©) uses more bytes (in this case 2) it may make things more complicated... Luckily we have american keyboards at school

## CPP00
Wondering whether to have the instance variables as parameters from the constructor... which kinda makes more sence to me. In the end I didn't do it cos since we will be creating all the contacts before we have that information, all those values would just be null. So... might as well just go the "naive" way.
