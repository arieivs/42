    #ports: Exposes container ports. # still need to understand
    #domainname: is that the thing we should use to svieira.42.fr = localhost ?
    #entrypoint: this will override ENTRYPOINT in dockerfile, and CMD maybe as well?


# configs

#   location of the mount point within the container defaults to /<config-name>
configs:
  nginx_config:

# do I really need a config?

# networks
